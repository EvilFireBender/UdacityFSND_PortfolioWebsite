# Portfolio Website

The accompanying code builds a portfolio website using HTML and CSS.
Note that the content of the website has been set to random text and stock photos for the time being.
This is because the point of this project was to exercise my HTML and CSS skills.
Actual content can be substituted in when the need arises.
